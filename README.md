# Django Settings Generator with Comments in French

This Cookiecutter template aims to generate a Django settings directory separated for development and production environments.

Each configuration variable is commented in French to help French-speaking beginners quickly get started with their first deployment.

## Generating the Settings Directory:

The following procedure will allow you to generate separate customized settings for development and production. You will need the Cookiecutter tool, which you can install beforehand using the command `pip install cookiecutter`. You can also use Cookiecutter without installation if you use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) by prefixing the commands with `uvx`.

1. Open a terminal at the root of your Django project.
2. Generate a settings directory using the command `cookiecutter gh:placepython/django-settings-fr`
3. Answer the questions asked.
4. Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal at the end of the installation.
